## PART 1: Python
1. Describe what is meant by an array in programming.
   Ans: An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, usually of the same data type, in a contiguous block of memory.

2. What is meant by "zero-based indexing"? Use an example.
   Ans: This means the counting of elements starts at 0 rather than 1. For example, in a list [10, 20, 30], the first element (10) is at index 0.

3. In the Python program below, what will be the output and why? The output will be:
    names = ["Ama", "Kojo", "Yaw", "Esi"]
    print("The second name is:", names[1])
    names[1] = "Kwame"
    print(names[1])

  Ans:
  The second name is: Kojo
  Kwame Reason: The code first prints the element at index 1 ("Kojo"). It then updates index 1 to "Kwame" and prints the new value.
